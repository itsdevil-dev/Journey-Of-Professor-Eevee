      <h2>About Umbreon</h2>
      <p>
        Umbreon is a Dark-type Pokémon that evolves from Eevee when it has a strong bond with its Trainer and evolves at night. It is admired for its elegance, stealth, and stoic presence. Unlike many Pokémon, Umbreon thrives in darkness and draws its power from the calm, mystic glow of the moon. It is known for its loyalty, protective instincts, and patience in battle. Umbreon can wait silently for the perfect moment to strike, making it both graceful and formidable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its silky black fur and golden rings glow when exposed to moonlight, creating a mesmerizing and eerie sight in the dark. It’s often regarded as a guardian of the night, watching over its trainer and territory silently.

      <h2>Abilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Synchronize:</strong> If Umbreon is inflicted with a status condition, it passes the same condition back to the enemy—like a karmic curse.</li>
        <li><strong>Inner Focus (Hidden Ability):</strong> Keeps Umbreon composed even under pressure, preventing it from flinching and maintaining its silent focus in battle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Umbreon's abilities make it a defensive wall in battles. It's not just about brute force—it plays smart, waiting for the right opportunity to counterattack and frustrate opponents with status effects and powerful dark-type moves.

        Umbreon’s strengths lie in its Defense and Special Defense, making it extremely tough to bring down. It's not designed to be a speedy attacker but rather a strategic wall that absorbs damage and wears down foes over time.

      <h2>Moonlight Aura</h2>
      <p>
        Umbreon’s glowing rings are its most iconic feature. When Umbreon becomes agitated or senses danger, these rings pulse with an eerie light, unnerving opponents. This visual display isn’t just for show—it symbolizes Umbreon’s deep connection with lunar energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        During battle, Umbreon can use the move "Moonlight" to heal itself by absorbing lunar energy. This makes it even more durable in long battles, giving it a chance to restore health while staying on the field longer. The moon isn’t just its power source—it's part of Umbreon’s very soul.
