      <h2>About Leafeon</h2>
      <p>
        Leafeon is a Grass-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. It evolves from Eevee when exposed to a Leaf Stone or leveled up near a Moss Rock. With a calm and serene nature, Leafeon blends into forest environments and purifies the air around it. Its body smells of fresh grass, and it can even perform photosynthesis, making it unique among Pokémon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leafeon often spends its time basking in sunlight, surrounded by rustling leaves and calm breezes. It’s a gentle Pokémon, living in harmony with nature and bringing peace wherever it goes.

      <h2>Nature's Spirit</h2>
      <p>
        Known as the embodiment of spring and natural renewal, Leafeon teaches us how to stay rooted while also growing toward the light. Just like trees shed leaves to grow again, Leafeon symbolizes peaceful change and quiet strength.

      <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
      <p>
        Leafeon's tail is as sharp as a blade. In battles, it uses it like a sword, slicing through opponents with graceful, leaf-like movements. Despite its elegance, it’s a strong and swift fighter.
